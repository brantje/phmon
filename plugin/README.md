# PhMon phBot plugin

PhMon.py is the phBot-side connector for the self-hosted PhMon backend. Each running
phBot instance owns one stable agent identity and makes its own outbound WebSocket
connection. The plugin reports connectivity facts; durable identity, authentication,
history and future command policy remain server-owned.

## Install

1. Provision a credential from the PhMon dashboard with **Create credential**, or
   use the CLI for a headless/operator flow:

       docker compose exec server phmonctl agent create

   Both paths generate the credential in the Go backend. The agent_id and agent_token
   are shown once while PostgreSQL stores only the token hash. Keep the plaintext
   token private.

2. Copy plugin/PhMon.py into the phBot Plugins directory and reload the plugin.
3. Join the game with the account/profile you want to configure.
4. Open **Plugins -> PhMon** and enter:
   - Backend WebSocket URL, for example `wss://phmon.example.internal/agent`
   - Agent ID from the dashboard or CLI provisioning result
   - Agent token from that same one-time result
5. Click **Save & Connect**. The agent should appear in PhMon after the authenticated
   hello handshake succeeds.

Configuration is profile-scoped. PhMon asks phBot for the active player's
`get_config_path()` and `get_profile()`, derives a matching filename, and stores
its own settings in:

    <phBot Config>/PhMon/<active-profile>.cfg

PhMon never modifies phBot's player JSON; the documented phBot API warns that direct
changes to that JSON may be overwritten. The player configuration separates
accounts/characters and the explicit profile name separates multiple named profiles
for the same character.

The saved file contains the bearer token because automatic reconnect requires it.
Keep the phBot Config directory private. QtBind documents a normal line edit rather
than a password widget, so the token is visible while being pasted; PhMon clears the
token field immediately after loading/saving and reuses the stored token only when
the displayed backend URL and agent ID still match.

The default Compose binding keeps the Go agent listener on loopback. Use ws:// only
when the plugin runs on the same host or on an explicitly trusted development network
with a deliberate SERVER_BIND_ADDR override. For remote agents, terminate TLS in
front of Go and configure wss://; the plugin uses normal system certificate
validation and does not provide an insecure TLS bypass.

Do not put the token in the backend URL. The plugin rejects URL credentials, query
parameters and fragments so secrets do not leak into logs, browser history or proxy
access logs.

## Runtime behavior

The plugin uses only Python standard-library networking. Public phBot documentation
verifies socket support but does not document a bundled third-party WebSocket client,
so no pip install inside phBot is required. A real phBot runtime still needs to verify
the embedded availability/behavior of ssl, select, threading, hashlib, base64, struct
and urllib.parse; simulator CPython is not evidence for that gate.

A dedicated worker thread owns WebSocket connect/read/write work. It polls readiness
before starting a frame, then completes the frame under a bounded socket deadline; a
mid-frame stall fails the connection rather than resuming from a partially consumed
stream. The worker sends the protocol-v1 hello, follows the server heartbeat interval
and reconnects automatically with bounded exponential backoff and jitter. finished()
only signals shutdown and closes the worker socket; latency-sensitive phBot callbacks
never wait for backend I/O.

The plugin stores no durable event queue. Later slices will add current-state and
event messages over the same authenticated connection.

## Simulator

For development without a Windows/phBot process:

    PHMON_AGENT_URL='ws://127.0.0.1:8081/agent' \
    PHMON_AGENT_ID='...' \
    PHMON_AGENT_TOKEN='...' \
    python3 scripts/agent_simulator.py

The simulator imports the exact same transport/worker implementation as the plugin
and reports simulator-fixture as its phBot version. It is test tooling only and is
never evidence that real phBot integration has been validated.
